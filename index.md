The Puget Sound Repeater Roundabout is a weekend-long event held on many of our local repeaters. The goal is to meet new people and work repeaters you might not usually key up. Light up the airwaves and make some noise on the great repeaters in the Puget Sound area!

**The Puget Sound Repeater Roundabout will begin on November 19th, 2022 at 00:00, and end on November 20th, 2022 at 23:59, Pacific time.**

Anyone with a ham radio license can participate! You don't even have to be local; stations may participate over Echolink or Allstar if they are available.

# Repeaters

Only these [113 participating repeaters from 50 radio groups](/repeaters) are eligible for scoring points in the Repeater Roundabout. Please stick to these repeaters; we don't want to annoy anyone who did not want to bring the contest to their repeater.

Please ensure that there is no ongoing activity on a repeater (such as a net) before you call for contacts. We cannot interfere with normal operation.


# Exchange

You should exchange

- your name
- a mention of the "Puget Sound Repeater Roundabout"
- a _received_ signal report (such as [RST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-S-T_system) or [CM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_Merit)). This must be how well _your signal_ sounds on the repeater, not how well you hear the repeater!

Feel free to chat about anything and everything, though! The goal is to have a conversation.


# Scoring

You score one point for each repeater you make a contact on. Multiple contacts on the same repeater do not provide more points. The person you contact does not necessarily have to be participating in the Repeater Roundabout -- any contact counts.

**Bonus : Collect 'em all !** If you make a contact on *all repeaters* with the same club designation on the list of participating repeaters (for systems with at least two repeaters), your point score doubles for that system. For example, the PSRG operates a 2m repeater, a 6m repeater, and a 70cm repeater. If you log a contact on all three of them, you score six points instead of three.


# Logging

You should log

- the date and time (in Pacific time) of the contact
- the callsign of the person you contacted
- their signal report for your signal
- the repeater's Repeater Roundabout number (RR#) -- see the [repeaters page](/repeaters).

You must use [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Frz6BoFUzWNTmiYED5OW_NTWhY-cSMRZQnhvdga4ORE/edit?usp=sharing) for logging, to make it easier to calculate your points. To get started, click on `File`, then `Make a copy` or `Download`.

Here's an example log file :

| Date    | Time  | Callsign | Report  | RR# |
|:--------|:------|:---------|--------:|:----|
| Nov 19  | 11:32 | KI7RMU   |     CM5 | 1   |
| Nov 19  | 17:02 | KD7DK    |      59 | 35  |
| Nov 20  | 08:51 | K7RCH    |     CM4 | 57  |
| Nov 20  | 13:16 | KX2CW    |     CM2 | 22  |
| Nov 20  | 13:16 | KD7WGN   |      45 | 102 |

Logs can be submitted [on this page](/submit_logs). After the contest, a leaderboard will be published on this website. Logs must be returned to K7DRQ by November 27th to qualify.


# FAQ

Is there a prize ?
: Fame and fortune await you ! Or at least fame. There might be a trophy too.

Can I arrange a contact beforehand ?
: Yes, skeds are perfectly okay ! Arranging your QSO beforehand is perfectly fine.

Can I use Echolink or Allstar ?
: You sure can ! The rules are the same, and nothing changes in the way you log your contacts. If a repeater has Echolink or Allstar, you can use it to make your contact.

Will each repeater have a club member monitoring ?
: No -- these contacts are as organic as possible. Get on a repeater, ask to chat to someone, and see what happens. If you're lucky, you'll find someone who's also participating in the Repeater Roundabout, and you can share your progress. If they aren't, you can still chat about anything and everything, and the contact still counts.

Can I send logs in ADIF format ?
: No, sorry. The [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Frz6BoFUzWNTmiYED5OW_NTWhY-cSMRZQnhvdga4ORE/edit?usp=sharing) is the only way to log your contacts.
