title: Repeater Roundabout
subtitle: Get to know your local repeaters November 23rd and 24th.

# About

The Repeater Roundabout is a weekend-long event held on many of your local repeaters. The goal is to meet new people and work repeaters you might not usually key up. It's also a great way to get started with ham radio contests for folk who are primarily repeater users. 

Last year, we made it into [QST Magazine](assets/RR.pdf). Light up the airwaves and make some noise on the great repeaters in Washington and Idaho ! Anyone with a ham radio license can participate. This is a friendly, collaborative event for all FM users on VHF and UHF.


**The Repeater Roundabout will be held during the weekend of November 23rd and 24th.**

## Repeater Standings

This table shows how many contacts were made on each repeater, including duplicates. The Readability score is the average signal report across all reports for that repeater -- it's the number of the CM report, or the R in an RS(T) report.
