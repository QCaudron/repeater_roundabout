# About

The Repeater Roundabout is a weekend-long event held on many of your local repeaters. The goal is to meet new people and work repeaters you might not usually key up. It's also a great way to get started with ham radio contests for folk who are primarily repeater users. Light up the airwaves and make some noise on the great repeaters in Washington State !

**The Repeater Roundabout will be held during the weekend of November 23rd and 24th.**

Anyone with a ham radio license can participate ! This is a friendly, collaborative event for all FM users on VHF and UHF.
