# About

The Repeater Roundabout is a weekend-long event held on many of your local repeaters. The goal is to meet new people and work repeaters you might not usually key up. It's also a great way to get started with ham radio contests for folk who are primarily repeater users. 

Last year, we made it into [QST Magazine](assets/RR.pdf). Light up the airwaves and make some noise on the great repeaters in Washington and Idaho ! Anyone with a ham radio license can participate. This is a friendly, collaborative event for all FM users on VHF and UHF.


**The Repeater Roundabout will be held during the weekend of November 22nd and 23rd, 2025. Watch this space!**
